## 📘 Chapter 1: HTML Components

This project covers **6 core HTML topics**, implemented step by step in a single application.

---

## 1️⃣ Basic Structure of an HTML Document

In this step, we created the basic skeleton of an HTML page.

### Concepts Covered:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`

### Learning Outcome:
- Understood how every HTML document starts
- Learned which tags are mandatory
- Learned the difference between metadata and visible content

---

## 2️⃣ Common HTML Tags

We added basic content to the page using common HTML tags.

### Tags Used:
- Headings: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`
- Paragraphs: `p`
- Images: `img`
- Links: `a`

### Learning Outcome:
- Learned how content is structured visually without CSS
- Understood the purpose of `alt` attribute in images
- Learned how links work using `href` and `target`

---

## 3️⃣ Creating Lists and Tables

We displayed structured data using lists and tables.

### Tags Used:
- Lists: `ul`, `li`
- Tables: `table`, `tr`, `th`, `td`

### Learning Outcome:
- Learned when to use lists vs tables
- Understood table rows, headers, and cells
- Learned how HTML represents data in rows and columns

---

## 4️⃣ Using HTML Forms for User Input

We added a student registration form to collect user input.

### Tags Used:
- `form`
- `label`
- `input`
- `select`
- `option`
- `textarea`
- `button`

### Learning Outcome:
- Learned how browsers collect user data
- Understood the role of `id`, `name`, and `for`
- Learned how form submission works without JavaScript

---

## 5️⃣ Semantic HTML

We restructured the application using semantic HTML tags to improve meaning and accessibility.

### Semantic Tags Used:
- `header`
- `main`
- `section`
- `footer`

### Learning Outcome:
- Understood the importance of semantic structure
- Learned how screen readers and search engines interpret HTML
- Learned the difference between semantic and non-semantic HTML

---

## 6️⃣ HTML5 New Tags and Attributes

We enhanced the application using modern HTML5 features.

### HTML5 Features Used:
- Input types: `email`
- Attributes: `required`, `minlength`, `placeholder`
- Meta tags:
  - `charset`
  - `description`
  - `viewport`

### Learning Outcome:
- Learned how HTML5 provides built-in validation
- Understood how browsers handle invalid input
- Learned how HTML5 improves user experience without JavaScript

---

## ✅ Final Result

A complete **HTML-only application** that:
- Is structured correctly
- Uses semantic HTML
- Collects user input
- Uses HTML5 validation
- Requires no CSS or JavaScript

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

> HTML is responsible for **structure and meaning**, not behavior or styling.

This project builds a strong foundation for learning:
- CSS (presentation)
- JavaScript (behavior)
- Frontend frameworks (React, etc.)

---

## 📌 Next Steps (Optional)

- Add CSS for styling
- Add JavaScript for form handling
- Validate HTML using W3C Validator
- Convert this into a React component later

---

Happy learning 🚀
```
