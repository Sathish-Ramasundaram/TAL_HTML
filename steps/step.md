# Step 1 — Basic Structure of an HTML Document

1. Create a file named: index.html

type nul > index.html

2. Add this code: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Student Registration App</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    Hello, this is my first HTML application.

  </body>
</html>

3. 

Let’s go line by line.

<!DOCTYPE html>
Tells the browser: “This is an HTML5 document”
Without this → browser may behave weirdly

<html>
Root element
Everything in HTML lives inside this

<head>
Metadata (not visible to users)
Page title, charset, SEO info (later)

<title>
Appears on:
Browser tab
Bookmark name

<body>
Actual UI
Whatever the user sees goes here

4. Output you should see
Browser tab title: Student Registration App

Page text:
Hello, this is my first HTML application.
